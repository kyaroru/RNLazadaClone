## React Native Lazada Clone App

## Notes from Carol
I did this as part of a coding test from a company.
Initially I have informed them of my expected salary, & they had reviewed my CV and said approved to proceed to next stage. So they gave me this assessment :p 

It was very weird as I am applying for React Native developer position, but the test they provided is for React.js.
After consulting them, they say until the RN template is ready, candidate have to use the React.js template. ðŸŽƒ

I also asked do I still need to clone the React.js one or I already can create a brand new RN app and commit to a new repository.
They replied no, I still need to clone the React.js template, then wipe out the codebase, and start committing my RN code. ðŸ¤¯

Well, I already created an RN version in another new [repo](https://github.com/kyaroru/ReactNativeACNTest) since they only reply my question the next day after I ask the question. After that, I proceed with what they requested, forked their React.js repository into this repository, then migrate my old one from [here](https://github.com/kyaroru/ReactNativeACNTest)

It took me 3 days (midnight - after working hours & after dinner) to finish the requirement (4 tests in total).
When I finished and submitted to them, there is no reply from them until I follow up with them 4 days later.

It is only now they told me my assessment has passed but because my salary is little bit out of their budget, so they will not proceed interview with me ðŸ˜¢

They could've told me earlier before I start doing this assessment.
